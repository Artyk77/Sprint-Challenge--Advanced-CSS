Responsive sites and adaptive sites are the same in that they both change appearance based on the browser environment they are being viewed
 on (the most common thing: the browser's width).

Responsive websites respond to the size of the browser at any given point. No matter what the browser width may be, the site adjusts its 
layout (and perhaps functionality) in a way that is optimized to the screen.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first ?

going down to smaller resolutions.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

The rem unit is relative to the html tag. That means that we can define a single font size on the html tag and define all rem units 
to be a percentage of that. Defining a font-size of 62.5% would size rems in a way that is similar to using px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
